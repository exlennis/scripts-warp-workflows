description: "list and sort directories based on their last modification times. The first command focuses on hidden directories (those starting with a dot) within the user's home directory, while the second command targets all top-level directories. Both commands utilize the stat utility to retrieve the modification timestamp and directory name, sorting the output in reverse order to display the most recently modified directories first."
